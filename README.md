# :wave: Hi there! 
My name is Casey Masamitsu. These days, Iâ€™m living in New York City with my partner and our dog.:dog: When Iâ€™m not working as a technical project manager & financial advisor, Iâ€™m typically learning as much as I can about data analytics and policy at Johns Hopkins University.<br>
<br>Otherwise, you can find me listening to music (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3pnzymgHgFEbD18XfmxOKY?si=4bcb03b159e04418" target="_blank">here are my favorite songs from 2021</a>), playing games, eating too much :pizza::bento:, or traveling (albeit not as much lately).

Currently I am finishing my graduate degree in data analytics and policy at Johns Hopkins University.:school: Check out some of my work in my <a href="https://www.cjmasamitsu.com/portfolio">portfolio!</a><br>
<br>In addition, I work full-time as a technical project manager and financial advisor in FinTech.:chart_with_upwards_trend: More specifically, I design and implement digital banking solutions for credit unions and other not-for-profit financial institutions.<br>

<br>But mostly, I'm a dog dad. :dog:<br>
