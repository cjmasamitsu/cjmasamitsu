# :wave: Hi there! 
## Welcome to my GitHub!

##### :man_student: _Please don't judge, I'm currently under construction!_ :man_student: <br>
<br>
My name is Casey Masamitsu. I live in New York City :cityscape: with my partner and my dog. I like extracting actionable insights from data, music, games, and travelling. <br>
<br>
Currently, I'm a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University :school:, pursuing my MS in Data Analytics and Policy. As the amount of data available to us accumulates exponentially, I believe we have a responsibility to use it responsibly to make he world a better place. Take a look around my repositories to see what I have been up to while in in school. :eyes: <br>
<br>By day, I am a Technical Project Manager and licensed Financial Advisor at a FinTech company offering digital banking solutions to not-for-profit credit unions. <br>
<br>
But mostly, I'm a dog dad :dog: <br>
<br>Meet Hastings:
