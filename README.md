# :wave: Hi there! 
## Welcome to my GitHub!

##### _Please don't judge, I'm currently under construction!_ 👨‍🎓 <br>
<br>
My name is Casey Masamitsu. I live in New York City with my partner and my dog. In response to the uprising of misinformation, I chose to pursue a MS in Data Analytics and Policy from Johns Hopkins University. I care deeply about using the plethora of data available to us for social good. Take a look around my repositories to see what I have been up to while in in school. :eyes: <br>
<br>By day, I am a Technical Project Manager and licensed Financial Advisor at Access Softek. <br>
<br>
But mostly, I'm a dog dad -- Meet Hastings:
