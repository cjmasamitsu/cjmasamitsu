# :wave: Hi there! My name is Casey Masamitsu.
## Welcome to my GitHub!

<p style="color:red;">Please don't judge, I'm currently under construction!</p> 👨‍🎓 <br>
<br>
Right now, I am pursuing my MS in Data Analytics and Policy from Johns Hopkins University. Take a look around my repositories to see what I have been up to while in in school. I care deeply about using data for social good. Let's connect! :eyes: <br>
<br>By day, I am a technical project manager, licensed financial advisor, husband, New Yorker, and dog dad. <br>
<br>
But mostly, dog dad. Meet Hastings:
