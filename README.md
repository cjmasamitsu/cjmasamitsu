# :wave: Hi there! 
My name is Casey Masamitsu. These days, Iâ€™m living in New York City with my partner and our dog&#x1F415. When Iâ€™m not working as a technical project manager & financial advisor, Iâ€™m typically learning as much as I can about data analytics and policy at Johns Hopkins University. Otherwise, you can find me listening to music (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3pnzymgHgFEbD18XfmxOKY?si=4bcb03b159e04418">here are my favorite songs from 2021</a>), playing games, eating too much&#x1F9C0, or traveling (albeit not as much lately).
 <p>
Currently I am finishing my graduate degree in data analytics and policy at Johns Hopkins University.&#x1F3EB Check out some of my work in my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio!</a><br>
<br>In addition, I work full-time as a technical project manager and financial advisor&#x1F4C8 in FinTech. More specifically, I design and implement digital banking solutions for credit unions and other not-for-profit financial institutions.
</p>
But mostly, I'm a dog dad. :dog:<br>
